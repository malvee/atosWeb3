		<h1>Project Scope</h1>
		The aim of the entire project as specified by our client is to develop a product that can be configured to automatically route social media activity to the most appropriate person(s) and/or system(s) to enable a fast response. This action has been split into two phases and the scope of the first part of the project is to have a product that can pull in data from social media platforms, analyze that tweet and display only the type of tweets that the user in interested in seeing. Upon completion of this first phase in term-1, the system has been extended during term-2 to a better-backgrounded, more efficient piece of software, with more features added. 
		
		<h1>Project Progression</h1>
		We have captured the progress of our team in the form of Gantt-chart as follows:<br><br>

		<h1>Project Requirement</h1>
		The requirements are presented in the format of a MOSCOW table which have been gathered from the client via the initial description of the project and bi-weekly meetings. Also, there is a column attached in order to show the status of our progress regarding each feature.

<h2> Project Runtime </h2>
The Project is specified to run privately on the clients device such as a laptop or tablet. Bootstrap has been used to scale the application to the platform on which it is running but mostly the application is going to be run on a screen that can handle a native website's architecture. For this purpose the Linux OS has not been customized with additonal packages as the private web application is suited to the machine that it will be running on. 

<h2> Work Packages </h2>
The following image shows the Work Packages we have been working on. During the project, we have divided the tasks accordingly so that we can fill up all the aspects of the application. The timeline under whch we have projected this can be found in the Gantt chart which is displayed on this page.

<h2> Project management </h2>
The hardest part of our project among the implementation itself was the resource and time manangement that we had to do. We have used a simple, but efficient technique in order to do it: 
<ul>
	<li>Evaluate</li>
	<li>Design</li>
	<li>Develop</li>
	<li>Analyze</li>
</ul>
Each of us has played an imprtant role in the team and being able to divide the work flexibilly was key for the success of the project. We tried to balance the tasks according to skills each of us has had before the starting of the project, but all of us have gained a lot of experience and learnt new stuff. Of course, at every point we needed to make a decision on something, we analysed everything and tried to be as efficient as possible. The Gantt chart that is displayed on top of this page shows how efficient we have been in reaching tasks during the second term. Also, the Work Packages show that we have clearly divided the work properly and equally and we knew where we were at at every point of the project. Of course, some of the tasks had to be done individually (Alvee - bag of words implementation, Chaitanya - Emoji rendering, Andreas- Date and link rendering), but we have shown that we can work as a team as well. One important aspect of our project manangement strategy was never leaving a task until successfully completing it. We had to postpone a few meetings with our client in order to do it, but in the end, it prooved a good taken risk.
