			<h1>Project Scope</h1>
				The aim of the entire project as specified by our client is to develop a product that can be configured to automatically route social media activity to the most appropriate person(s) and/or system(s) to enable a fast response. This action has been split into two phases and the scope of the first part of the project is to have a product that can pull in data from social media platforms, analyze that tweet and display only the type of tweets that the user in interested in seeing. Upon completion of this first phase in term-1, the system will be extended during term-2 to automatically route the information to appropiate personell within the system.

				For term-1 we are expected to have an interface which will display the relevant tweets in real time from the moment the user logs into the system to 5 hours before the login. The user will be able to filter the displayed tweets via the three labels: Good, Bad, Neutral. 
			
			<h1>Project Progression</h1>
			We have captured the progress of our team in the form of Gantt-chart as follows:<br><br>

			<h1>Project Requirement</h1>
			The requirements are presented in the format of a MOSCOW table which have been gathered from the client via the initial description of the project and bi-weekly meetings.

			<h2> Project Runtime </h2>
			The Project is specified to run privately on the clients device such as a laptop or tablet. Bootstrap has been used to scale the application to the platform on which it is running but mostly the application is going to be run on a screen that can handle a native website's architecture. For this purpose the Linux OS has not been customized with additonal packages as the private web application is suited to the machine that it will be running on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
