			<h1>Background and context</h1>
				Atos is focused on business technology that powers progress and helps organisations to create their firm of the future. With its deep technology expertise and industry knowledge, the Group works with clients across different business sectors: Defence, Financial Services, Health, Manufacturing, Media and Utilities, Public Sector, Retail, Telecommunications and Transportation. With Transportation being one of its sectors, it ensures welfare of the railways services with an aim to make travelling by train easier for customers. This includes everything from entering the station to finding a place in the desired train. They are now looking for a new approach and try to refresh their services in order to make them better. This is where we come in. <br><br>

				The aim of our project is to analyze some of the most important social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter etc.) for possible feedback from the customers in real time. Using the feedback that we will find regarding some issues in the station or in the trains we will then in turn enable responsible people to solve the issues. Train operating companies and Network Rail monitor social media (predominantly Facebook and Twitter) as a way of managing customer satisfaction. The greatest success with this approach is when the information can be acted upon quickly. For example, a passenger complains on Twitter that their train is not showing a platform and 30 seconds later the platform is posted and there is a response on Twitter detailing the action that has been taken. The challenge is how to route the information available on Twitter and Facebook rapidly to the correct people and/or system(s) that are able to take the appropriate corrective action.The aim of this project is to develop a product that can be configured to automatically route social media activity to the most appropriate people and/or system(s) to enable a fast response. A possible further extension is to allow the person/system that actions a response to reply to the original reporter with details of the action that was taken. Another possible extension is the provision of a dashboard that shows an analysis of activity in social media channels in real time including a summary of which have been routed for action and which have been actioned.
				<br><br>
				In order for the project to be a success, we should:
				<ul>
					<li>Get real tweets and/or facebook posts fed into the app as input.</li>
					<li>Have a functional sentiment analysis algorithm.</li>
					<li>Have an elegant and user-friendly UI.</li>
 				</ul>

				The client has decided to use the SCRUM development techniqur which involves working in two week sprints and meeting after each sprint to decide next sprint's goals as well as track progress. The summary of each and every sprint can be found under the Archive tab of our website and are termed as Bi-weekly reports. Here is a table that provides an overview of the project so far:
