				<h1>User Interface</h1>
				Two exercises were carried out before making a solid decision on the appearance of the UI. The first one was production of a powerpoint presentation by each team member where personal ideas about different aspects of the UI had to be described. Each team member started with the same template and added features in an iterative manner to complete the second exercise. Observation of advantages and disdvantages, checking Norman's principles and prototype evaluation led to acceptance of UI produced by these exercises. It can be found in the <a href="prototypes.html">Prototypes</a> section of this website and includes design for the prototype due end of term one as well as design for the final project due end of academic year. <br><br>
				There were several factors needed to be identified and highlighted in the powerpoint presentation:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Understanding user needs (please note that these are not the same as the system requirements).</li>
					<li>The slides should show clearly how users would interact with the system.</li>
					<li>The UI design applies some of Normanâ€™s design principles (affordance, feedback, visibility, consistency, constraints).</li>
					<li> The slides should demonstrate creation of a lo-fi prototype of all or part of the UI design and use a appropriate evaluation method to evaluate the low-fi prototype with a minimum of two participants.</li>
					<li> There should be evidence of reflection on the implications of the user evaluations for future iterations of their UI design.</li>
				</ul>
