		<h1>Technical Achievements</h1>
		<p>The biggest technical achievement has been implementation of the Bag Of Words algorithm from scratch. The entire algorithm along with all the related files is self-contained within 15 files. The code base is fairly complex with over 2400 hundred lines of hand written code.</p> 
		<p>Handling JavaScript and HTML 5 inside PHP became a bit tricky. This was because managing " and ' symbols became very confusing and frustrating. The mix-up of " and ' while being passed to and from JavaScript and PHP caused the missing box problem where the container for a tweet would appear empty but upon inspecting the HTML 5 element inside a browser, it was observed that the tweet was present but it wasn't appearing because it had clashed with a previously matched " or ' or unescaped \. These were minor difficulties but nontheless painful and annoying.</p>
		<p>We worked with Twitter's Streaming and Search APIs. The Streaming API was used to collect the training data for the algorithm and the Search API is used in the application to fetch recent tweets.</p>
		<p>Each tweet was required to be displayed in a specific format. This format included rendering emoticons and hyperlinks within the tweet text and converting the timestamp of the tweet into a readable format (like 1m ago, 2h ago etc.). The Twemoji library was used to render emoticons and self-written functions were used to achieve hyperlink rendering and easy-to-read date format.</p>
		<p>The main difficulty in this application was the sentiment analysis algorithm on which we spent a considerbale amount of time on, tweaking and experimenting to try to increase its accuracy and at the same time make sure it is not being over-trained and can generalise well.
		<p>Another interesting achievement was the dynamic Control Panel where the user can add and delete multiple topics simultaneously. For example he user could delete 5 topics and add 10 more in one go. This is a major advantage over traditional add and delete mechanism where user would have to add and delete elements one at a time.    
		<h1>Implementation Details</h1>
		<p>When the user goes to the application url, he/she is prompted with a login screen where username and password have to be entered. This will be authenticated agaisnt an online databse. If the authentication is successfull the user is taken to the main page where the server looks up the entered username in the databse and retrieves a set of 100 tweets specific to the user's interest. </p>
		<p>These 100 tweets are then analysed by the Bag Of Words algorithm and each tweet is given a sentiment and a score. Depending on the sentiment and score each tweet container is given a sentiment colour and sentiment shade respectively. The tweet is also parsed to identify hyperlinks and emoticons. These are displayed in the tweet text along with profile picture of the tweet author and time elapsed since tweet creation.</p>
		<p>Comprehensive technical details of the entire application can be found in the <a target="_blank" href = "Technical documentation.pdf">Technical Documentation </a> including explanation of each file, its part in the overall application and how to extend the algorithm or re-train the model etc.</p>
		<h1>Use of Design Patterns</h1>
		<p>We followed a modified Strategy Pattern which allowed re-use of Session data over some period of time. In order to allow the user to filter the tweets it would be a waste to re-fetch the data and only display the selected sentiment. Instead the data is cached in a Session and passed to every other page requesting the data. So there is only copy of the data which is passed by reference and each page displays a sub-set of the data that the specific page is interested in. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Generator files:
				<p>Each part of the algorithm has a specific generator file that produces part of the algorithm. For example, "createNegativeArray.php", "createPositiveArray.php", "createStopArray.php", "trainModel.php" etc are examples of generator files. These files act on their corresponding data and generate the the serialized information needed by the algorithm.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Decoupling:
				<p>Changes in the algorithm are reflected via the master-slave relationship. The master files of the project are located in the bagOfWordsTrainer directory and using the generator files output a single change made in the master directory allows the changes to be reflected upon on the whole application. For example: if we add more training data to the training dataset then the generator file will create the new serialized information and update the algorithms data-model.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
					Smart pre-processing:
					<p>Instead of searching for stop words in each tweet, these words are filtered out at the data-model generation stage. This in-turn avoids re-computation and allows faster execution time.</p>
				</li>
